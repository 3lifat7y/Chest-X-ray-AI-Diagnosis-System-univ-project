# 🫁 Chest X-ray AI Diagnosis System

## 📌 Project Description
This project is an AI-based system designed to analyze **Chest X-ray images** and assist in the early detection and diagnosis of respiratory diseases using Deep Learning techniques.

The system aims to help doctors and healthcare professionals by providing fast and accurate predictions based on medical imaging data, reducing diagnosis time and improving decision-making.

By using artificial intelligence, the system can recognize patterns in X-ray images that may indicate diseases such as pneumonia, COVID-19, tuberculosis, and other lung conditions.
