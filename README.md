# 🫁 Chest X-ray AI Diagnosis System (NIH Dataset)

## 📌 Project Description
This project is an AI-based system designed to analyze **Chest X-ray images** and assist in detecting and classifying lung diseases using Deep Learning techniques.

The system aims to support doctors and healthcare professionals by providing fast and accurate predictions based on medical imaging data, helping in early diagnosis and better decision-making.

By using artificial intelligence, the system can recognize patterns in X-ray images that may indicate different chest diseases.
